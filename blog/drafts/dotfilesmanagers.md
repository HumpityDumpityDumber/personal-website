Dotfile Managers Suck
linux, hatred

## I'm probably not qualified to hate
To preface, I've really used Yolk and merely tried out other options like Chezmoi and Dotter. With Yolk I had a whole thing put together with Matugen where it would feed yolk colors for dotfiles that weren't literally just for colors. Especially things like niri's config.kdl, where imports aren't even an option, Yolk is actually kinda nice. I can edit my config without any running of rendering commands and it just works, but when my color scheme does change its nice to just have those automatically applied.
